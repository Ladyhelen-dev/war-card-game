# war-card-game

## Project Description

Implementation of the children's card game "War" using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Game Rules

- A standard 52-card deck is shuffled and split evenly between two players
- In each round, both players reveal their top card
- The player with the higher card takes both cards
- If cards are equal, it's "war": each player puts down three face-down cards and one face-up card
- The player with the higher face-up card takes all cards in play
- The game continues until one player has all the cards

## Technical Requirements

- Must use OOP principles (classes, objects, inheritance/polymorphism if applicable)
- Must implement the core game logic
- Should include unit tests
- Should have clear output showing game progress
- Should handle edge cases (empty hands, ties at end of game)

## Implementation Choices

- Input: Game will run automatically without user input
- Output: Console output showing each round's outcome
- Variation: Will implement standard rules (no special variations)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/war-card-game.git
2. Run `python war_game.py`
